# Trade-offs Are Inevitable

## Core Idea
There is no perfect system design.  
Every architectural decision involves sacrificing one quality to improve another.

Understanding and justifying these trade-offs is the core skill of system design.

## Common Trade-offs
Some trade-offs appear in almost every system:

- **Speed vs Safety**: Faster responses often reduce data guarantees
- **Cost vs Performance**: Better performance usually increases infrastructure cost
- **Simplicity vs Flexibility**: Simple designs are easier to maintain but less adaptable

Choosing one side always means accepting the downsides of the other.

## Why Trade-offs Matter
Ignoring trade-offs leads to:
- Over-engineered systems
- Unexpected failures under load
- High operational cost
- Difficult maintenance

Good system design is about making trade-offs **explicit and intentional**.

## Key Takeaway
Good system design is not about avoiding trade-offs.  
It is about understanding them and choosing the right compromises for the problem at hand.
